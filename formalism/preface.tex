\section{Preface}
\label{sec:preface}
This is the complete formalism demonstrating the \emph{marked lambda calculus}, a judgmental framework for
precise bidirectional error localization and recovery that employs gradual typing.

\subsection{Organization}
Though more is said in each individual section, the overall structure of the document is as follows:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cref{sec:marked} employs the framework on a gradually typed lambda calculus.

  \item \cref{sec:patterned} extends the demonstration with patterned let expressions.

  \item \cref{sec:polymorphism} extends the demonstration with System F-style parametric
    polymorphism.

  \item \cref{sec:untyped} gives a version of the Hazelnut structure editor calculus that uses the
    marked lambda calculus to solve Hazelnut's deficiency with regards to non-local hole fixes.

  \item \cref{sec:typed} is similar, except that it employs the marking procedure in a roughly
    incremental fashion.

  \item \cref{sec:constraint} gives the rules for constraint generation in relation to the type hole
    inference work of Section 4.
\end{itemize}
%
Note that each of the sections following \cref{sec:marked} build upon that same core language.

\subsection{Mechanization}
Not all parts of the formalism are mechanized in Agda. It is noted in each section whether or not
the section has been mechanized and, if so, where to find the relevant definitions and theorems.

As possible, the names of judgments and rules that appear in the mechanization have been made to
follow those in this formalism. Refer also to the mechanization's README for more details.
